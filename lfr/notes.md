## DropX Flow Validation Rules:

### Rule 1 - 

The first level of % should be mapping to a Droplet Generator

### Rule 2 – 

Any +-, distribute nodes before % should be in continuous flow

### (Incorrect) Rule 3 - 

Any Remetering (%) should require a droplet breakdown and regeneration

### Rule 4 – 

Distribute network post Metering stage should be mapped to different kinds of separator / selection/ storage networks

### Rule 5 –

If plus is shown between node that has % in pred and non % in pred, then its pico injection

### Rule 6 – 

If plus is sown between two nodes that has % in pred, then its droplet merging
